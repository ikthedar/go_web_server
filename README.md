# go_web_server
Built a web server with Golang

We have used several packages like fmt, log, net/http

After setting the up the main directory we created a static folder
The static folder contains our html files

Then we have another file called main.go which contains all the golang codes

We worked with 3 different routes here
Root, /hello and /form
